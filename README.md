The app features a refreshed UI with a original icon

![home page](/docs/2.PNG)

The home page displays a summary of all emissions from journeys and utility bills

![journey page](/docs/3.PNG)

Journey page. From here user can add a journey starting by selecting a transportation mode: bike/walk, bus, skytrain or car.

User can also press a journey to edit it(trans mode, car specs, route and date can all be edited). 

![add vehicle page](/docs/4.PNG)

If the transportation mode selected is car, user enters a menu of all saved cars, then user can choose to add a new car or select an existing car.

The vehicle page is powered by a SQLite database with real data from authority.

The vehicle data is from US EPA: http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml

After selecting car or other transportation mode, user enters a route menu, where user can select an existing route or create a new one(user can choose to not save the route).

When a journey is recorded, a tip is given to help users reduce emissions.
